What is Handwritten Digit Recognition, and how does it work?
The capacity of machines to detect human handwritten digits is known as handwritten digit recognition. Because handwritten digits are not flawless and can be generated with a variety of tastes, it is a difficult assignment for the computer. The way to solve this issue is handwritten digit recognition, which analyzes a picture of a digit to identify the digit present in the image.

The MNIST dataset is used in this app. Convolutional Neural Networks are a sort of deep neural network that we will use. Finally, we'll create a user interface that allows you to draw a digit and instantly recognise it.

Install any required libraries:
    pip install NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, pillow,
    
Among machine learning and deep learning aficionados, this is undoubtedly among the most popular datasets. The MNIST dataset includes 60,000 training photos of handwritten digits ranging from zero to nine, as well as 10,000 test images. As a result, the MNIST dataset comprises ten distinct classes. The handwritten numbers are represented as a 2828 matrix with grayscale pixel values in each cell.

-> Load the dataset and import the libraries
To begin, we will integrate all of the modules that we will require for training our model. MNIST is among the datasets already included in the Keras library. As an outcome, we can quickly import the data and start work with it. The mnist.load data() method returns both the training and testing data, as well as their labels.

-> Prepare the data for analysis
Because the picture input cannot be immediately fed into the model, we must perform some operations and process the data before it can be fed into our neural network. The training set has a dimension of (60000,28,28). We rearrange the matrix to shape the CNN model, which will require one extra dimension (60000,28,28,1).

-> Construct the model
Now, in our Python data science project, we'll build our CNN model. Convolutional and pooling layers are the most common layers in a CNN model. CNN works effectively for picture categorization challenges because it performs better with data that is represented as grid structures. The dropout layer is utilized to disable part of the neurons, which reduces the model's offer fit during training. After that, we'll use the Adadelta optimizer to compile the model.

-> Train the model
The prototype.fit()  Keras' function will begin model training. The training data, validation data, epochs, and batch size are all input. The model must be trained over time. We save the weights and model definition in the 'mnist.h5' file after training.

-> Evaluate the model
Our dataset contains 10,000 pictures that will be used to assess how well our model performs. Because the testing data was not used in the training of the data, it represents new information for our model. We can obtain approximately 99 percent accuracy with the MNIST dataset since it is nicely balanced.

-> Create a graphical user interface for predicting digits
Now for the GUI, we've built a new file in which we've constructed an interactive window in which we can draw numbers on canvas and recognize them using a button. The Python standard library includes the Tkinter library. We built the predicted digit() function, which accepts an image as input and predicts the digit using the trained model.
Then we develop the App class, which is in charge of creating the app's user interface. By recording the mouse event, we establish a canvas on which we may draw, and by pressing a button, we call the predicted digit() method and display the results.
